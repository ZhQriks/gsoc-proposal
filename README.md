- Synopsis:
  The Electron Release Working Group currently relies on several disparate automated tracks to track and communicate details about major **Electron** stable releases. This project aims to streamline this process by creating a release calendar website that will pull dates from the **Chromium API** and display them in a user-friendly manner. The website will be built using **React**. Additional information will be added to Slack using a bot built on the **Slack API**, notifying and editing via the **#wg-releases** channel


**About me**
=====================
Hi I am Zharasar from Kazakhstan, This year I am finishing 12th grade in high school. My main programming language is Javascript. I started at the age of 15 by creating simple applications interacting with DOM. Now at the age of 18 I develop complex projects using React & Typescript.

For 1.5 years I've been working at Owl Tribe outsourcing company where I've worked on 5+ projects including Electron, React-Native, Nextjs, Django. I love to participate in coding competitions, and have already won 10 hackathons. My latest project is Nodemap - AI Roadmap Generator. [Link](https://nodemap.vercel.app).

**Why me**
=====================
I alone became a developer at the early age of 15.  During this time I found an unrivaled passion for programming. I like to understand complex concepts and do the work quickly to get more feedback

When I was 15 years old and entered the Desktop Application Contest as a Web Developer, my eyes fell on Electron and when I entered the contest I transferred my project to desktop in just 5 minutes. Since that day I still find Electron to be magical and empowering for thousands of web developers

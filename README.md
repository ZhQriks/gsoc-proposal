**Project Description**
=====================
- Name: [ðŸ“… Releases Working Group Calendar Website](https://ccextractor.org/public/gsoc/rtorrent-modern-rpc/)
- Mentors: [@dsanders11](https://github.com/dsanders11), [@vertedinde](https://github.com/vertedinde)
- Synopsis:
  The Electron Release Working Group currently relies on several disparate automated tracks to track and communicate details about major **Electron** stable releases. This project aims to streamline this process by creating a release calendar website that will pull dates from the **Chromium API** and display them in a user-friendly manner. The website will be built using **React**. Additional information will be added to Slack using a bot built on the **Slack API**, notifying and editing via the **#wg-releases** channel


**About me**
=====================
Hi I am Zharasar from Kazakhstan, This year I am finishing 12th grade in high school. My main programming language is Javascript. I started at the age of 15 by creating simple applications interacting with DOM. Now at the age of 18 I develop complex projects using React & Typescript.

For 1.5 years I've been working at Owl Tribe outsourcing company where I've worked on 5+ projects including Electron, React-Native, Nextjs, Django. I enjoy to participate in coding competitions, and have already won 10 hackathons. My latest project is Nodemap - AI Roadmap Generator. [Link](https://nodemap.vercel.app).

## Deliverables:

1. React website to monitor team beta and stable release dates:
   - Prerequisites for the project
   - Receiving data from the express server
   - Coding a custom component for a calendar
   - Style the components using CSS

2. Express server modifications:
   - Fetching release data from the Chromium API
   - Storage of fetched data
   - Implement data syncing with the Slack
   - Endpoints for the React website

3. Documentation for **Releases Working Group Calendar**:
   - Create user guides for the React website, explaining how to navigate and use the features
   - Provide documentation for the Slack bot, including instructions on how to install and use the bot

4. Slack Bot
   - Notifications of new calendar changes in slack
   - Interactive commands for manual change of information
   - Interaction with express

**Why me**
=====================
I alone became a developer at the early age of 15.  During this time I found an unrivaled passion for programming. I like to understand complex concepts and do the work quickly to get more feedback

When I was 15 years old and entered the Desktop Application Contest as a Web Developer, my eyes fell on Electron and when I entered the contest I transferred my project to desktop in just 5 minutes. Since that day I still find Electron to be magical and empowering for thousands of web developers
